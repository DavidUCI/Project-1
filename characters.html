  <h2>Iden Versio<br>
    Iden Versio is the Commander of Inferno Squad, an Imperial Special<br> 
    Forces commando unit that was established by her father, Admiral Garrick<br>
    Versio.  Having participated in the Battle of Endor, she witnessed the<br> 
    fall of the Empire, which led to the death of the Emporer and the destruction<br> 
    of the second Death Star.  Upon the Emporer’s death, one of his final actions<br>
    was the approval of Operation: Cinder, where Versio was selected along with other<br> 
    Imperial officers to carry out orbital bombardments, however, it is this operation<br> 
    that makes Iden question her loyalty to the Empire.

<h3>Gideon Hask<br>
    A member of Inferno Squad, Gideon Hask, nicknamed “Gid”, was a soldier and starfighter pilot during the Galactic Civil War before joining Inferno Squad.  Both his physical and mental strengths, as well as his relationships with his Inferno Squad teammates, are tested in this story of good and bad.
</h3>

<h4>Del Meeko<br>
    Del Meeko is the third member of the Inferno Squad and comes from the planet Coruscant, which was the capital world of the Galactic Empire during the Imperial Era.  Del Meeko is particularly special as he has served the Empire for a long time, and thus, climbed his way up the ranks.  He served as a stormtrooper in the Imperial Military, as a shoretrooper with the rank of sergeant, as an Imperial Starfighter Pilot, and as the chief engineer of a Star Destroyer, being one of the most experienced and decorated members of the Inferno Squad.  He joined Inferno Squad following the Rebel Alliance’s theft of the Death Star plans, roughly between the events of Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and Episode IV: A New Hope.  Having this experience, Meeko should be a vital member of the Emporer’s Operation: Cinder, or will he put his own beliefs before the Empire?
